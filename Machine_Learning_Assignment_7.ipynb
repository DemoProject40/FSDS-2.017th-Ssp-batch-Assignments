    "### Q1. What is the definition of a target function? In the sense of a real-life example, express the target function. How is a target function&#39;s fitness assessed?\n",
    "### Ans - A target function, in machine learning, is a method for solving a problem that an AI algorithm parses its training data to find. \n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q2. What are predictive models, and how do they work? What are descriptive types, and how do youuse them? Examples of both types of models should be provided. Distinguish between these two forms of models.\n",
    "### Ans - Predictive modeling is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. Predictive modeling solutions are a form of data-mining technology that works by analyzing historical\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q3. Describe the method of assessing a classification model&#39;s efficiency in detail. Describe the various measurement parameters.\n",
    "### Ans- There are many ways for measuring classification performance. Accuracy, confusion matrix, log-loss, and AUC-ROC are some of the most popular metrics. Precision-recall is a widely used metrics for classification problems.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q4. In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is the most common reason for underfitting?\n",
    "### Ans -It occurs when a model is too simple, which can be a result of a model needing more training time, more input features, or less regularization. Like overfitting, when a model is underfitted\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q5. Is it possible to boost the efficiency of a learning model? If so, please clarify how.\n",
    "### Ans - There are several ways to increase the accuracy of a regression model, such as collecting more data, relevant feature selection, feature scaling, regularization, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the learning rate, and ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q6. How would you rate an unsupervised learning model&#39;s success? What are the most common success indicators for an unsupervised learning model?\n",
    "### Ans - Twin sample validation can be used to validate results of unsupervised learning. It should be used in combination with internal validation. It can prove to be highly useful in case of time-series data where we want to ensure that our results remain same across time.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q7. Is it possible to use a classification model for numerical data or a regression model for categorical data with a classification model? Explain your answer.\n",
    "### Ans - Essentially, the way we determine whether a task is a classification or regression problem is by the output. Regression tasks are concerned with predicting a continuous value, whereas classification tasks are concerned with predicting discrete values.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q8. Describe the predictive modeling method for numerical values. What distinguishes it from categorical predictive modeling?\n",
    "### Ans - Predictive modeling is a mathematical process used to predict future events or outcomes by analyzing patterns in a given set of input data. It is a crucial component of predictive analytics, a type of data analytics which uses current and historical data to forecast activity, behavior and trends.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q9. Make quick notes on:\n",
    "1. The process of holding out\n",
    "2. Cross-validation by tenfold\n",
    "3. Adjusting the parameters\n",
    "### Ans - the process of splitting the data into different splits and using one split for training the model and other splits for validating and testing the models.\n",
    "### BWith this method we have one data set which we divide randomly into 10 parts. \n",
    "### To define an adjustment calculation method, you must specify one or more parameters, depending on the method.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q10. Define the following terms:\n",
    "1. Purity vs. Silhouette width\n",
    "### Ans - In the table below, each row corresponds to one cluster; large off-diagonal counts indicate that its cells are easily confused with those from another cluster. The main difference between the cluster purity and silhouette width is that the former ignores the intra-cluster variance.\n",
