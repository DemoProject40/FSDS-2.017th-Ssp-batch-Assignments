    "### Q1. Provide an example of the concepts of Prior, Posterior, and Likelihood.\n",
    "### Ans - If you are classifying the buyers of a specific car, you might already know that 60% of purchasers are male and 40% are female. \n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q2. What role does Bayes&#39; theorem play in the concept learning principle?\n",
    "### Ans - Bayes theorem helps to determine the probability of an event with random knowledge.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q3. Offer an example of how the Nave Bayes classifier is used in real life.\n",
    "### Ans- Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q4. Can the Nave Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?\n",
    "### Ans - If an instance in test data set has a category that was not present during training then it will assign it “Zero” probability and won't be able to make prediction.\n",
    "### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Q5. What are Bayesian Belief Networks, and how do they work? What are their applications? Are they capable of resolving a wide range of issues?\n",
    "### Ans - Bayesian network models capture both conditionally dependent and conditionally independent relationships between random variables.\n",

    "### Q6. In an oral exam you have to solve exactly one problem, which might be one of three types, A, B, or C, which will come up with probabilities 30%, 20%, and 50%, respectively. During your preparation you have solved 9 of 10 problems of type A, 2 of 10 problems of type B, and 6 of 10 problems of type C.\n",
